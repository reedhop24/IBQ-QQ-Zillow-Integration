# zillow-integration

##### This project was originally done for IBQ, built using Node.js, JQuery, Express, MongoDB, html, css.

##### Zillow's Real Estate and Mortgage API is used to collect information regarding Neighborhood and city affordability statistics: Zillow Home Value Index, Zestimate distribution, median single family home and condo values, average tax rates, and percentage of flips. Though being in insurance we were only concerned with the Zestimate value of a home. 

##### We were already capturing the customers address early in our UI, therefore the input boxes were something I added simply in order to make this a portfolio project. In IBQ's UI once we received the Zestimate I was just appending it as a Div onto our HTML.

##### I also created the back end for this including a proxy to send the request to as a way of avoiding any CORS issues.
