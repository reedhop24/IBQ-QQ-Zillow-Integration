# zillow-integration

#### This project was originally done for IBQ, built using Node.js, JQuery, Express, MongoDB, html, css.

#### Zillow's Real Estate and Mortgage API is used to collect information regarding Neighborhood and city affordability statistics: Zillow Home Value Index, Zestimate distribution, median single family home and condo values, average tax rates, and percentage of flips. Though being in insurance we were only concerned with the Zestimate value of a home. 

#### We were already capturing the customers address early in our UI, therefore the input boxes were something I added simply in order to make this a portfolio project. In IBQ's UI once we received the Zestimate I was just appending it as a Div onto our HTML.

#### When I developed this project for IBQ I had sent it through our server so there was no need for a proxy. However, being a portfolio project I built out a proxy in order to avoid a CORS error. For IBQ I was also creating the model and storing that data on the back-end, while also clearing house of that data after a month. So a lot of the back end work I am doing in this project is also on IBQ's back-end.
